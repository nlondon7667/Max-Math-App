# PWA SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

## How to Install as iPhone App:

### Option 1: Direct Install (Easiest - Works Now!)
1. Open `exeter_math_neon_tts.html` in Safari on iPhone
2. Tap the Share button (square with arrow)
3. Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. Name it "Math Boss Battle" (or whatever Max wants!)
5. Tap "Add"
6. App icon appears on home screen! 🎮

### Option 2: Full PWA Setup (For Best Experience)
If you want the full PWA with offline support and better performance:

1. **Upload these files to a web server:**
   - exeter_math_neon_tts.html
   - manifest.json
   - sw.js

2. **Create app icons (optional but recommended):**
   - icon-192.png (192x192 pixels) - neon math themed
   - icon-512.png (512x512 pixels) - neon math themed

3. **Access via HTTPS:**
   - PWAs require HTTPS
   - GitHub Pages is free and easy: github.com/USERNAME/repo
   - Or use Netlify Drop: app.netlify.com/drop

4. **Install on iPhone:**
   - Open the URL in Safari
   - Tap Share → "Add to Home Screen"
   - Works offline once installed!
